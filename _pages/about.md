I'm an undergraduate Honors student at the University of South Alabama majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics.

I very actively participate on my university's campus through our student organizations. I am currently the Tutoring Chair of our chapter of the [Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)](/about/organizations/#association-for-computing-machinery), which allows me to coordinate tutors in the School of Computing to work with students one-on-one. Additionally, I am one of two elected [Student Government Association (SGA)](/about/organizations/#student-government-association) Senators representing the USA School of Computing. My duties as part of the student Legislature include participation in our Rules and Legal Affairs Committees. I am also the Secretary of our [DayZero Cyber Competition Team](/about/organizations/#dayzero-cyber-competition-team), a student organization which promotes professional development in cybersecurity through hands-on learning and experience.

In addition to my extra-curricular activities and participation in student organizations, I also regularly participate in local and national collegiate-level cybersecurity, programming, and Mathematical competitions. I am a national finalist in the Cyber FastTrack Program, a cybersecurity competition for which I [earned a full scholarship](/about/media/#media2) for the SANS Technology Institute Undergraduate Certificate Program in Applied Cybersecurity. I've also [twice achieved a positive score](/about/competitions/#william-lowell-putnam-mathematical-competition) in the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical competition, a contest for which the median score is often zero.

I also work as a research assistant for my university as part of our Computing Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) program. As part of this program, I conduct research in the areas of circuit obfuscation and program protection. I have published my work to the [ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC)](/about/publications/#pub1), presented my research at the [NSF Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) Principal Investigators' Meeting](/about/presentations/#secure-and-trustworthy-cyberspace-satc-meeting) in Virginia, and been invited to attend the Workshop for Women in Cybersecurity Research (Colocated with CODASPY).
