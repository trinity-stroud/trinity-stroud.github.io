## About Linux

### What is Linux?

Linux is a family of operating systems, also called distributions or distros, which make use of the kernel. The Linux kernel is the core of a Linux distro and it interfaces directly with the hardware components of a computer. There are different kinds of distributions: desktop distributions and server distributions.

Desktop distros have a GUI, or Graphical User Interface. Examples of desktop distros are the Elementary OS, which is designed for general users, and Kali Linux, which is designed for cybersecurity professionals. Server distributions are specialized for use on servers and do not come with a GUI pre-installed.

### Linux Terminal

When you open a terminal on a Linux machine, the first thing you will be greeted with is the prompt. Though this can be customized and may vary from distribution to distribution, it will generally take the following form:

``` user@hostname:~$ ```

...where ```user``` is the user account and ```hostname``` is the hostname of the computer. Additionally the ```~``` symbol is shorthand for the home folder of the current user. This is useful shortcut that can be used with many Linux commands.

When a terminal is opened, the program being run is referred to as the shell. The shell is responsible for displaying the prompt in the terminal, interpreting commands entered in the terminal, and running programs.

The most common shell is Bash (Bourne Again Shell), which is based on the predecessor shell called sh (Bourne shell).
